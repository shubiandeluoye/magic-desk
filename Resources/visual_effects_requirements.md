# Visual Effects Implementation Requirements

## 1. Magic Book Page Turn Effect
- Implementation: Custom animation system + particle effects
- Components needed:
  * Book page mesh with custom UV mapping
  * Simple particle system for page flutter
  * Basic animation controller
- Performance considerations:
  * Use minimal vertex count for book mesh
  * Limit particle count to 50-100
  * Single-pass shader for page rendering

## 2. Frosted Glass Button Effect
- Implementation: Custom shader
- Components needed:
  * Simple fragment shader for blur effect
  * Normal map for glass texture
- Performance considerations:
  * Use small blur kernel (3x3 or 5x5)
  * No real-time blur, pre-calculated where possible
  * Single-pass shader

## 3. Button Ripple Effect
- Implementation: Custom shader
- Components needed:
  * Simple vertex/fragment shader
  * Single texture for ripple pattern
- Performance considerations:
  * Use distance fields for ripple calculation
  * Limit active ripples per button
  * Share ripple texture across all buttons

## 4. Particle Effects
- Implementation: Unity Particle System
- Components needed:
  * Basic particle prefabs
  * Shared particle materials
- Performance considerations:
  * Maximum 200 particles per effect
  * Use particle system pooling
  * Shared materials for similar effects

## 5. Color Transitions
- Implementation: Unity UI system + simple shader
- Components needed:
  * Color gradient definitions
  * Basic UI shader for transitions
- Performance considerations:
  * Use RGB instead of HSV for transitions
  * Limit number of simultaneous transitions

## Required Shader Files
1. `/Resources/Shaders/FrostedGlass.shader`
2. `/Resources/Shaders/ButtonRipple.shader`
3. `/Resources/Shaders/BookPage.shader`
4. `/Resources/Shaders/UITransition.shader`

## Required Texture Files
1. `/Resources/ArtAssets/Textures/book_page_normal.png`
2. `/Resources/ArtAssets/Textures/glass_normal.png`
3. `/Resources/ArtAssets/Textures/ripple_pattern.png`

## Animation Requirements
1. Book opening sequence
   - Duration: 1.5 seconds
   - Keyframes: 5 (minimum)
   - Events: particle trigger points

2. Button press feedback
   - Duration: 0.2 seconds
   - Simple scale/color animation
   - Ripple effect trigger

## Mobile Performance Targets
- Maximum draw calls per frame: 50
- Maximum vertex count per effect: 1000
- Target frame time: 16ms (60 FPS)
- Memory budget for effects: 50MB

## Implementation Priority
1. Basic UI layout and button functionality
2. Frosted glass effect for buttons
3. Button ripple effects
4. Book opening animation
5. Particle effects and polish

Note: All effects should be tested on mobile hardware before final implementation. Shader complexity should be adjusted based on performance metrics.
